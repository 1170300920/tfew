{"id": 1398, "claim": "p16INK4A degradation is encoded by CDKN2A.", "gold_evidence_text": "In 14 of 14 tested tumor models, expression of p16(LUC) was focally activated by early neoplastic events, enabling visualization of tumors with sensitivity exceeding other imaging modalities.This work suggests that p16(INK4a) activation is a characteristic of all emerging cancers, making the p16(LUC) allele a sensitive, unbiased reporter of neoplastic transformation.Expression of p16(INK4a) with aging did not predict cancer development, suggesting that the accumulation of senescent cells is not a principal determinant of cancer-related death.", "label": "NEI"}
{"id": 285, "claim": "Continued HHV-8 transmission among MSM in San Francisco may be explained by urogenital contact.", "gold_evidence_text": "Any declines in the incidence of Kaposi sarcoma do not appear to be caused by a decline in KSHV transmission.OBJECTIVES To determine the prevalence of KSHV infection in homosexual men in San Francisco, Calif, at the beginning of the HIV epidemic in 1978 and 1979 and to examine changes in prevalence of KSHV at time points from 1978 through 1996 in light of changes in sexual behavior.   \nCONCLUSIONS Infection with KSHV was already highly prevalent in homosexual men when the HIV epidemic began in San Francisco, and its prevalence has been maintained at a nearly constant level.", "label": "NEI"}
{"id": 211, "claim": "COPI coatmer is involved in viral replication.", "gold_evidence_text": "Furthermore, RNAi inhibition of ATGL and simultaneous drug treatment indicate that COPI and ATGL function in the same pathway.Those include the vesicle-mediated Coat Protein Complex I (COPI) transport complex, which is required for limiting lipid storage.Two compounds known to inhibit COPI function, Exo1 and Brefeldin A, phenocopy COPI knockdowns.", "label": "NEI"}
{"id": 262, "claim": "Cis-acting lncRNAs control the expression of genes that are positioned in the vicinity of their transcription sites.", "gold_evidence_text": "The importance of COOLAIR splicing in this repression mechanism was confirmed by disrupting COOLAIR production and mutating the COOLAIR proximal splice acceptor site.This was revealed through analysis of a hypomorphic mutation in the core spliceosome component PRP8.Our findings suggest that altered splicing of a long noncoding transcript can quantitatively modulate gene expression through cotranscriptional coupling mechanisms.", "label": "NEI"}
{"id": 425, "claim": "For every 1,000 children with cerebral palsy, more than 300 of them are premature or underweight at birth.", "gold_evidence_text": "CONTEXT Although cerebral palsy (CP) among extremely premature infants has been reported as a major morbidity outcome, there are difficulties comparing published CP rates from many sites over various birth years.   \nCONCLUSION Population-based CP prevalence rates for children whose gestational age was 20 to 27 weeks and whose birth weight ranged from 500 to 1249 g show steady reductions in the last decade with stable or reducing mortality, reversing trends prior to 1992-1994.RESULTS At age 2 years, 122 (14.2%) of 858 survivors had CP.", "label": "NEI"}
{"id": 361, "claim": "During the primary early antibody response activated B cells migrate toward the inner-and outer follicular areas where oxysterol accumulation is generated by stromal cells.", "gold_evidence_text": "Recent studies have identified a role for the orphan receptor, EBV-induced molecule 2 (EBI2; GPR183), in guiding activated B cells to inter and outer follicular niche(s) and down-regulation of this receptor is essential for organizing cells into GCs.The chemokine, CXCL13, plays a central role in guiding B cells to follicles whereas T-zone chemokines guide activated B cells to the T zone.B cells must migrate from niche to niche in a rapid and highly regulated manner to successfully mount a response.", "label": "NEI"}
