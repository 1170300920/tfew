{"id": 988, "claim": "Pseudoknots are not evolutionarily conserved in most eukaryotes.", "gold_evidence_text": "Both of the RNAs have a highly conserved helical region, P4, which is important in the catalytic reaction.RNases P and MRP are ribonucleoprotein complexes involved in tRNA and rRNA processing, respectively.The RNA subunits of these two enzymes are structurally related to each other and play an essential role in the enzymatic reaction.", "label": "NEI"}
{"id": 429, "claim": "Formation of N-terminal pyroglutamate by glutamine cyclase (GC) competes with NTAQ1 for Nt-Gln substrates.", "gold_evidence_text": "Deamidation of N-terminal Gln by Nt(Q)-amidase, an N-terminal amidohydrolase, is a part of the N-end rule pathway of protein degradation.Our site-directed mutagenesis of Ntaq1 and its crystal structure indicate that the active site and catalytic mechanism of Nt(Q)-amidase are similar to those of transglutaminases.We detected the activity of Nt(Q)-amidase, termed Ntaq1, in mouse tissues, purified Ntaq1 from bovine brains, identified its gene, and began analyzing this enzyme.", "label": "NEI"}
